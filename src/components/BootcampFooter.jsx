          Ushering The Era of Upskilling Back
        </h6>
        in 2013, Lejhro&apos;s founders noticed that the professional world, due
        to the fast-paced era today, demanded industry professionals to upskill
        continuously by keeping themselves up to date with current technology -
        not just for their company’s growth but also for their personal career
        goals as well. With cut-throat competition for jobs and increasing
        unemployment coupled with outdated education of workers, upskilling
        oneself is the only way to ensure one’s growth and stability. Formerly,
        learning would come to a halt after attaining one’s degree. It was
        Lejhro&apos;s innovative approach towards imparting learning through
        Bootcamps curated especially for working professionals and programs that
        brought about a change in the industry practices and pushed people to
        upskill themselves. We, at Lejhro, have always strived to impart quality
        and world-class education to the workforce through pioneering courses to
        make them job-ready.
        <h6 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", margin: "20px 0px" }}>
          A Flexible and Futuristic Approach
        </h6>
        From the inception, teaching, and upskilling of a huge set of
        professionals and students alike Lejhro has come a long way. All thanks
        to its approach of staying future-ready and being ahead of its
        competitors by divulging an era of quality courses to upskill oneself.
        This approach has not only helped us to expand our horizons but has also
        helped us form a family of people with an ever-learning approach. Our
        aim to cater to various segments of working professionals according to
        their requirements has brought positive and impactful results and helped
        Lejhro carve its own place in the ed-tech industry. Only onwards and
        upwards from here!
        <h6 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", margin: "20px 0px" }}>
          Growth - The Only Constant{" "}
        </h6>

        these years is our growth as well as the growth of those who are
        associated with us. We as an organization have always strived to go
        above and beyond our current capabilities and bring out-of-the-box
